#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
  -Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. 
  -Software engineering enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life eg,communication, commerce,etc.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
 **The Development of Programming Languages (e.g.C)**
  -In the early days of computing, people had to write programs in machine code, which was extremely difficult and error-prone. To make programming easier, special languages were created that allowed programmers to write instructions in a more understandable way.
**The Establishment of Software Engineering as a Discipline in the 1960s**
  -As software became more complex, people realized that programming alone wasn’t enough. They needed a systematic way to manage the entire process of creating software, from planning and design to testing and maintenance therefore software engineering was introduced to describe this approach and this shift led to the development of tools, methods, and best practices that helped to create better and more reliable software on time and on budget.
**The Advent of Structured Programming in the 1970s**
  -Before structured programming, software was often written in a chaotic way, with "spaghetti code" that was hard to follow and debug. Structured programming introduced a clear, organized way of writing code.
**The Rise of Agile Methodologies in the 2000s**
  -Traditional software development methods were often rigid and slow, with long cycles between planning, development, and delivery. Agile methodologies emerged as a way to make software development more flexible and responsive to change.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  **Planning** Identifying the project's scope and objectives.
  **Analysis**  Gathering detailed requirements and understanding what needs to be built.
  **Design** Crafting the architecture and design specifications.
  **Implementation (Coding)** Writing the actual code according to the design.
  **Testing** Verifying that the software works as intended and is free of bugs.
  **Deployment** Releasing the software to users.
  **Maintenance** Ongoing support and updates after the software is in use.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
**Waterfall Methodology**
  -The Waterfall method is linear and follows a strict sequence of phases(sequential structure): requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Each phase must be completed before the next begins.
  -Examples include building Infrastructure (e.g., Bridges, Buildings),developing Safety-Critical Systems (e.g., Medical Devices, Aircraft Software)
**Agile Methodology**
  -Agile breaks down the project into small, manageable chunks (sprints), with each sprint delivering a working piece of the product(iteraticve structure). The process is cyclical, allowing for continuous feedback and adjustments.
  -Examples include Startup Product Development,Software as a Service (SaaS) Development.
  
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  **Software Developer:** Writes, tests, and maintains code; transforms design into functional software.
  **Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer:** Tests software for defects, ensuring quality and reliability before release.
  **Project Manager:** Oversees the project, ensuring it stays on schedule and meets objectives; coordinates between team members and stakeholders.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
**IDEs**
  -IDEs provide a comprehensive workspace for coding, debugging, and testing, increasing productivity.
  -Examples: Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA.
**VCS**
  -VCS tracks changes to code, enables collaboration, and allows rollback to previous versions.
  -Examples: Git (with GitHub or GitLab), Subversion (SVN).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
  -Challenge: Managing complexity.
    -Strategy: Break tasks into smaller, manageable pieces; use design patterns and modularization.
  -Challenge: Keeping up with rapidly changing technology.
    -Strategy: Continuous learning through courses, reading, and hands-on practice.
  -Challenge: Debugging and fixing bugs.
    -Strategy: Write clean, well-documented code; use debugging tools and systematic testing.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
**Unit Testing:** Testing individual components or modules of software.Important for catching bugs early in development.
**Integration Testing:** Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.Critical for identifying issues in how parts of the system interact.
**System Testing:** Testing the entire software system as a whole.Ensures the entire software works as a whole.
**Acceptance Testing:** Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.Ensures the final product is ready for release and use.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
-Prompt Engineering is the process of designing, refining, and optimizing the input  provided to an AI model to get the best response possible.
-Prompt engineering helps avoid asking  vague questions and getting  confusing answers by making your questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
-Vague Prompt:“Tell me about history.”
-Improved Prompt:“Provide a brief overview of the key events in World War II, focusing on the causes and major battles.”
-The improved prompt is more effective because it narrows down the scope of the inquiry, making the AI's task clearer. This results in a response that is tailored to the user’s specific interest, providing useful and relevant information without the need for additional clarification
